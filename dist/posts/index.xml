      <description>In the previous post, I&amp;rsquo;ve shared what we&amp;rsquo;re going to build and why. Today, we&amp;rsquo;re gonna finally do some real work - we&amp;rsquo;ll build flask application and we&amp;rsquo;ll run it in docker.
Let&amp;rsquo;s get started
I&amp;rsquo;ll start with building a docker image for our flask application. Let&amp;rsquo;s write a Dockerfile for it. I expect you to have some experience with docker, if you don&amp;rsquo;t - I recommend you to check this website.</description>

      <title>Intervention Ninja - flask app running on AWS ECS (#01)</title>

      <description>When I was working at Skyscanner, we had the whole tribe responsible for continuous integration and continuous deployment tools. Getting your service out to production (AWS ECS), was just the matter of merging PR to master and the rest was like &amp;ldquo;magic&amp;rdquo;. You didn&amp;rsquo;t need to worry about that.
It is must have for fast-paced company like Skyscanner, that their engineers rather spend time delivering business features then worrying about build and deployment.</description>

      <title>Running hugo on AWS</title>

      <description>Hello visitor!
I&amp;rsquo;ve just created this blog site using hugo and I&amp;rsquo;m excited about it! :) I&amp;rsquo;ll be using this place to share my ideas, thoughts and experience.
The first &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; blog post will most likely be about Intervention Ninja. That&amp;rsquo;s my spare time project, which I&amp;rsquo;ve built to demonstrate how simple is to get stuff done on AWS.
This site itself is also hosted on AWS. It actually sits in AWS S3 and it&amp;rsquo;s delivered to you through AWS CloudFront (content delivery network).</description>
