      <description>When I was working at Skyscanner, we had the whole tribe responsible for continuous integration and continuous deployment tools. Getting your service out to production (AWS ECS), was just the matter of merging PR to master and the rest was like &amp;ldquo;magic&amp;rdquo;. You didn&amp;rsquo;t need to worry about that.
It is must have for fast-paced company like Skyscanner, that their engineers rather spend time delivering business features then worrying about build and deployment.</description>
