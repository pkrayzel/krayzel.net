### The important stuff in my life

The purpose of this page is to **remind me of what's important in my life**, when things don't go as planned.
These are things I want to do from the perspective of different roles I play in this world.

**As a father**:

- Spent quality time with kids every day
- Take them out for a whole weekend every few months

**As a husband**

- Help my wife more with everything :)
- Spent quality time with her (ideally go out for breakfast once a week) 

**As a friend**

- Go out for a beer / lunch with my friends every 2-3 weeks

**As a professional**

- Have a good feeling from work without the need to over-work
- Work on sharing knowledge
  - eg. write a blog post at least once a month
  - the goal is to practice for:
    - writing a public blog posts regularly
    - giving a speech at technical conference
    - potentially write a technical book later
- Focus on the Breadth of Technical Knowledge (in order to become a software architect)

**As a musician**

- Practice guitar regularly
- Participate in the weekly rehearsals with rock-metal band Angel Saxx 
- Be ready for the first concert when things will reopen (September the 9th 2021) 

### My personal challenges

- **The 5am Club** 
  - inspired by the book "The 5am Club" and in order to enable more of the above, I'm waking up at 5am on work days and starting the day with myself

- **practice german on Duolingo every day**

- **learning something every working day** 
  - **reading a chapter of a book/technical article**
  - **watching a talk**
  - **reading a blink on blinkist** 

- **work on my personal technology radar once a week**
  - inspired by the [Build your own technology radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/build-your-own-technology-radar) article
