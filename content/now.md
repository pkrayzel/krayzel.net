Inspired by Derek Sivers and his <a href="http://nownownow.com" target="_blank">nownownow.com</a> site, 
Iâ€™m adding my own version as well. 

These are my current challenges:

- **running 100 km every month** 
  - I've started this challenge in October, so my total target for this year is "only" **650 km**

- **reading a book every month** 
  - currently reading **The Lean Startup** by **Eric Ries**

- **writing 1 blog article every two weeks** 

I'm also: 

- learning new songs on electric guitar
  - currently **Walk** and **Learn to Fly** by Foo Fighters

- learning for **AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate** examination
  - my goal is to pass the examination by Q1 2019
