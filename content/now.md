Inspired by Derek Sivers and his <a href="http://nownownow.com" target="_blank">nownownow.com</a> site, 
Iâ€™m adding my own version as well. It's mostly for me, to remind me of what's important in my life.  

**As a father**:

- Spent quality time with kids every day
- Take them out for a whole weekend every few months

**As a husband**

- Help my wife more with everything :)
- Spent quality time with her (ideally go out for breakfast once restaurants are open again) 

**As a friend**

- Go out for a beer / lunch with my friends every 2-3 weeks

**As a professional**

- Have a good feeling from work without the need to over-work
- Work on sharing knowledge
  - eg. write a discourse post/blog post once a month Hotjar
  - the goal is to practice for:
    - giving a speech at technical conference
    - writing a public blog post regularly
    - potentially write a technical book later
- Focus on the Breadth of Technical Knowledge (in order to become a software architect)

**As a musician**

- Practice guitar regularly
- Participate in the weekly rehearsals with rock-metal band Angel Saxx 
- Be ready for the first concert when things will reopen 

**My personal challenges**:

- **The 5am Club** 
  - inspired by the book "The 5am Club" and in order to enable more of the above, I'm waking up at 5am on work days and starting with myself 
- **learning german on Duolingo every day** 
- **reading a chapter of a book every working day**
- **reading a blink on blinkist every working day**
