Inspired by Derek Sivers and his <a href="http://nownownow.com" target="_blank">nownownow.com</a> site, 
Iâ€™m adding my own version as well. It's mostly for me, to remind me of what's important in my life.  

**As a father**:

- Spent quality time with kids every day
- Take them out for a whole weekend every few months

**As a husband**

- Help my wife more with everything :) 
- Have an evening out with her every 1-2 months

**As a friend**

- Go out for a beer / lunch with my friends every 2-3 weeks

**As a professional**

- Prepare and give a talk at some good Software conference in 2020 (aim for O'Reilly SA in Berlin November 2020)
- Practice Architectural Katas with a group of friends / coworkers at least once a month
- Focus on the Breadth of Technical Knowledge (in order to become a software architect)
- Write a blog post every month 

**As a musician**

- Practice guitar daily
- Participate in the monthly rehearsals with rock-n-roll band Andilci 
- Be ready for a first concert in Q1 2020 

**My personal challenges**:

- **running 100 km every month** 
  - I've successfully finished this challenge last year (October - December 2018 with **700 km**)
  - Keeping it in 2019 as well, January - October **1050 km** 

- **reading a book every 1-2 months** 
  - currently reading **Domain-Driven Design** by **Eric Evans**
