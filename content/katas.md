Architectural Katas are intended as a small-group (3-5 people) exercise, usually as part of a larger group (4-10 groups are ideal), each of whom is doing a different kata. A Moderator keeps track of time, assigns Katas, and acts as the facilitator for the exercise.

Each group is given a project (in many ways, an RFP–Request For Proposal) that needs development. The project team meets for a while, discovers requirements that aren’t in the orignal proposal by asking questions of the “customer” (the Moderator), discusses technology options that could work, and sketches out a rough vision of what the solution could look like. Then, after they’ve discussed for a while, the project team must present their solution to the other project teams in the room, and answer challenges (in the form of hard-but-fair questions) from the other project teams. Once that challenge phase is done, the room votes on their results, and the next project team takes the floor.

### Rules

Basic rules of the architectural katas are described [here](/architectural_katas/rules)!

### Why it's here?

In November 2019, I've attended O'Reilly Software Architecture conference in Berlin and I've been lucky to be able to 
participate in Architectural Katas event hosted there. I was also lucky to be (hopefully valuable) member of a winning team as you can see on the tweet bellow :)

However that's not what I wanted to share here... ok, I did want to mention that. Anyway, it was such a great experience that I've decided 
to try organize this myself. 

### Events

To be organized! Stay tuned :)
