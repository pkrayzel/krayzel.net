When I was working at Skyscanner, we had the whole tribe responsible for continuous integration and continuous deployment tools & flows. 
Getting your service out there to AWS (production), was just the matter of merging PR to master and the rest was like "magic". You didn't need to worry about that.

It is must have for fast-paced company like Skyscanner, that their engineers rather spend time delivering business features then worrying about build and deployment. 
  
Today, I want to convince you, that getting your services to AWS is not that difficult, even if you don't have the whole tribe behind your back.
