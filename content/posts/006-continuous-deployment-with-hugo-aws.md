Hey!

As you're reading this article about continuous deployment - you should know, that it was also automatically build and deployed to production.

Today, I wanna show you how - because it's incredibly simple!

Let me remind you some of the terminology here. If you're familiar with the words **continuous integration** and **continuous deployment**, 
feel free to skip to the next paragraph.

> Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) describe practices for automating the release of software. The two terms are semantically different, but go hand in hand. You will often see them referenced together or used interchangeably.

> Continuous Integration minimizes integration problems by constantly integrating and testing changes to the code. This is achieved by running automated tests whenever code is contributed to a project.

> Continuous Deployment is the practice of automatically releasing updates to production. CD is an extension of CI â€” you will want to run your integration tests before deploying your code, relying on automated testing to ensure the integrity of the production software.
