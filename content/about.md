Hey there! 

My name is Pavel and I'm based in Prague, Czech Republic. To be honest, I live in a small village near to Prague, however no one knows this place, so let's stick with Prague. 

I'm a tech lead, people manager of 5 engineers, father of two kids, husband of one wife and owner of one dog. 

I'm currently leading a distributed team of software engineers spread across the whole Europe.
My team is working for London-based company MADE.COM in the area of logistics - specifically on warehouse & carrier integrations.
