Hey there! 

My name is Pavel and I'm based in Prague, Czech Republic. To be honest, I live in a small village near to Prague, however no one knows this place, so let's stick with Prague. 

I'm father of two kids, husband of one wife and owner of one dog and also senior software engineer. 

I'm currently working in a fully distributed company called Hotjar which has people spread across the whole world, the majority of them in EMEA.
